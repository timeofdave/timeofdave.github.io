## My Projects

This is a webpage for my personal projects. Not all of my projects are on GitHub (especially older ones) but since I am migrating to GitHub, I figured they should have a cozy home.

Thanks for taking a look at some of things I enjoy spending free time working on!

### [RiteNote](https://sourceforge.net/projects/ritenote/)

Available for PC download on [SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/ritenote/).

I created the first version of RiteNote several years ago as a solution for taking notes in class, after finding that none of the existing applications had the clean, minimalistic, easy to use feel that I wanted.
