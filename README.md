## My Projects

This is a webpage for my personal projects. Not all of my projects are on GitHub (especially older ones) but since I am migrating to GitHub, I figured they should have a cozy home.

Thanks for taking a look at some of things I enjoy spending free time working on!

### [MovieMap](https://github.com/timeofdave/MovieMap)

Have you ever browsed Netflix aimlessly, hoping to find a movie you might like to watch? Have you ever googled 'best action movie list' in hopes of discovering a hidden gem of Hollywood? MovieMap predicts which movies you might like based on your similarity to other users. It's as if someone with the exact same taste as yourself ranked every movie out there and handed you the list.

MovieMap is under development. The UI is nearing MVP (minimum viable product), and it is connected to a third party API to retrieve the movie data.




### [RiteNote](https://sourceforge.net/projects/ritenote/)

Available for PC download on [SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/ritenote/).

I created the first version of RiteNote several years ago as a solution for taking notes in class, after finding that none of the existing applications had the clean, minimalistic, easy to use feel that I wanted.
