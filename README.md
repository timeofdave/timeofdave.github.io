### My Projects

This is a webpage for my projects. Not all of my projects are on GitHub (especially older ones) but since I am migrating to GitHub, I figured they should have a cozy home.

Unless explicitly stated, these are personal interest projects that I have created alone, outside of school or work. Thanks for taking a look at some of things I enjoy spending free time working on!




## [MovieMap](https://github.com/timeofdave/MovieMap)

Have you ever browsed Netflix aimlessly, hoping to find a movie you might like to watch? Have you ever googled 'best action movie list' in hopes of discovering a hidden gem of Hollywood? MovieMap predicts which movies you might like based on your similarity to other users. It's as if someone with the exact same taste as yourself ranked every movie out there and handed you the list.

MovieMap is under development. The UI is nearing MVP (minimum viable product), and it is connected to a third party API to retrieve the movie data. It's a web app using ASP.NET Razor pages with HTML 5 Canvas (JavaScript) for the UI.



## Bones

Bones is an idea I've had bouncing around my head for a long time, and only recently have started working on. There's a big market for construction type games; for example, bridge builders is an entire sub-genre. Bones is like that, but instead of building a bridge, you're building a dune buggy!

It's in the proof of concept stage, where I'm trying to decide whether the building interface is easy enough to use. Bones is targeted at mobile devices and created using Unity and C#.




## [RiteNote](https://sourceforge.net/projects/ritenote/)

Available for PC download on [SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/ritenote/).

I created the first version of RiteNote several years ago as a solution for taking notes in class, after finding that none of the existing applications had the clean, minimalistic, easy-to-use feel that I wanted. The interface is designed to be navigated from the keyboard, and the feature set focuses on efficiency. There are still a few important features missing, but I (and hopefully a few other people) still use it for taking class notes.

It was created using Livecode, which is a business-app creator that isn't very github-friendly. The project can be downloaded at sourceforge, but you'd need Livecode installed to look at it.




## TicTacToe AI

My latest attempt to make an AI that could teach itself simple board games. He learns quite well if a human takes the time to play against him, but he's still pretty shoddy if he only plays against himself.

I made this before I took any AI courses, so I'll probably try again after that.
